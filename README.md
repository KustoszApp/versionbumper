# Kustosz versionbumper

Focus on the worthwhile content with Kustosz, open source self-hosted web application.

versionbumper bumps version number. It uses git tags as single source of truth and supports only YY.MM.PATCH format used by Kustosz.

Contrary to many similar programs, versionbumper does not cover package publishing. This is best left to specialized tools.

versionbumper exists because, apparently, there's no generic tool that supports calver and multiple languages packaging without forcing specific publishing workflow at the same time.
